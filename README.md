## Heyy there!!

My name is Michael and I am a computational linguist based in Ukraine.

To put it simply, I enjoy exploring the intersection of human speech / text and machine code. 

I focus on various tasks in NLP, Machine Learning and Machine Translation. 

However, if an interesting project from a different field happens to come along my way, chances are I will pick it up.

My tech stack:
  * Programming languages: Python
  * Data Storage and Querying: MySQL, PostgreSQL
